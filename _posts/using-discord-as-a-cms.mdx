title: Using Discord as a CMS

During the final weeks of school back in 2019, me and a few other students were sick and tired of the so called food served in the cafeteria. We decided to photograph the food every day and display the images on a website. Since fancy solutions such as Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage exceeded the budget, I had to come up with a creative solution for storing and browsing hundreds of photos.

Being a gamer, I was familiar with Discord. I was *also* familiar with the wonderful Discord API – as well as the JavaScript library used to build chat bots. As far as I know, you can post as many messages in a Discord channel as you want – as long as the attachments are smaller than 8 megabytes (because I’m too cheap for Nitro). On top of that, the API used to interact with Discord is completely free and with generous limits!

Scrolling through a chat with potentially hundreds of messages wasn’t going to cut it for me, though. To improve user experience, a website had to be built. To be recognized, I had to make the first ever purchase for this project: a domain name. Given that the school is called Södermalmsskolan, södermalmsskolan.com seemed fitting. And cheap – only two Euros for the first year at GoDaddy!

The website was spartan at first, built with Express.js and deployed on my very own Kubernetes cluster. A website that used to serve the menu provided an RSS feed that södermalmsskolan.com parsed and presented. However, I knew it wouldn’t be *that* easy.

Me and my friends weren’t happy with the website and the photos. We wanted to spread the word about what we thought was important at the school, and we wanted to make it look professional. We wanted a blog.

Initially, the blog consisted of Markdown files in a GitHub repository. My friends were unsatisfied with the user unfriendly way of making big and small changes to various articles. There had to be a better way to do it.

Somehow, I came across Ghost. It is a wonderful CMS (just like Discord), and very easy to set up. I deployed it on my Kubernetes cluster and gave it its very own subdomain. My friends were delighted and I was proud. Hoping to make up for the fatal domain expenses, I also installed Google AdSense.

While the website worked flawlessly, the Handlebars engine was starting to be more of a pain than I had anticipated. We wanted to be able to display the blog posts on the front page of södermalmsskolan.com, but a server-side rendered template engine like Handelebars was too slow for the job. Moreover, I found myself repeating a lot of HTML and wanted reusable components.

Then came Next.js. Before Next.js, I had rejected React since I thought that it was only for single page applications – react-router was too exotic. Next.js, on the other hand, was easy to get started with thanks to the file-based routing that I was familiar with. After a few nights of coding, the React application was deployed on the cluster, complete with the blog posts!

A few months later, we felt the urge to add more features:
* A page displaying various Quizlet study sets.
* A schedule.
* A page listing the letters published by the teachers.

## The Quizlet Problem
Since we often need to learn strange new words, many of us use Quizlet. To share the “study sets” with the students, I created a Discord channel and a page on the website. Everything went well until I had to display the names of the linked study sets – Quizlet had deprecated their API! Left with no other options, I had to scrape their site.

## The Schedule Problem
A schedule was added to help the users keep track of time.

## The PDF Problem
Later, we also implemented a kind of news service. When users logged in with Firebase, they were able to view PDF files published by the teachers, complete with handy previews – directly on the website. Naturally, those PDFs were stored on Discord.

## Unexpected 404s in the middle of summer
Well over a year after launching the website, the menu just stopped working. A few hours of detective work revealed that the underlying service used to fetch the information had been discarded by my school. Unfortunately, the new service didn’t provide any way of programmatically getting hold of the menu. I had to scrape this, too.

During the summer, I had migrated the website from my Kubernetes cluster to Vercel. Since Vercel explicitly prohibits any form of web scraping, I decided to adhere to the terms of service for once and build a separate scraping API in Rust.

“Why Rust?” you might be asking. I have a lot more experience with JavaScript, and could have built the same service in a fraction of the time. But in order to learn, I did it with Rust. And deployed it on my own Kubernetes cluster.
